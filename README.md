# GEMLINES
![GIF of gameplay](/README/main_gif.gif)

GEMLINES is a remake of the classic game LINES 98, where you move and match balls against each other to score points. Well this is that, but with gems and other shenanigans!

Developed with Unity Personal v.2020.3.30f1

### "Gem"play

- Get 5 gems or more into a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line to clear them and earn points!
- Don't let the table be filled with gems!

-----------
### Special gems

- Ghost gems pass through other gems and let others pass through it.
- Rainbow gems can match with any other gems (that have a color).
- Cleaner gems clear an entire line, but only after moving.
- Blocks cannot be moved and can only be cleared with cleaner gems.

-----------
### Time Attack mode
![GIF of time attack mode](/README/time_atk.gif)

Time Attack mode puts the player under the stress of having a clock ticking by their ear. It is exactly the same as Normal mode, but you can make any number of moves you want. That is, until the clock ticks and new gems come into play.

-----------
### Debugging
All builds of the game have debugging disabled. If you want to set the gems yourself, download the source (a Unity project) and follow the instructions inside the Editor (I made it gigantic, can't miss it).

If debug mode is enabled, pressing F2 in-game will switch to debug mode and you can set the gems yourself on the board with left click and directional arrow keys.
