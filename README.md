# GEMLINES

GEMLINES is a remake of the classic game LINES 98, where you move and match balls against each other to score points. Well this is that, but with gems and other shenanigans!

### Special gems

-----------
### Time Attack mode
Time Attack mode puts the player under the stress of having a clock ticking by their ear. It is exactly the same as Normal mode, but you can make any number of moves you want. That is, until the clock ticks and new gems come into play.

-----------
### Debugging
All builds of the game have debugging disabled. If you want to set the gems yourself, download the source (a Unity project) and follow the instructions inside the Editor (I made it gigantic, can't miss it).
I
f debug mode is enabled, pressing F2 in-game will switch to debug mode and you can set the gems yourself on the board with left click and directional arrow keys.
